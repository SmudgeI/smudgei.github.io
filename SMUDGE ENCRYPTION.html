THIS CODE HAS BEEN DELETED AS A NEW AND IMPROVED VERSION HAS BEEN MADE AT "██████████████████████████"
THE MAIN IMPROVEMENTS ARE SECURITY RELATED... IF YOU SEE THIS, IT MEANS THAT YOU GOT THROUGH THE EARLY CLIENT-SIDE SECURITY SYSTEM "ANTI BYPASS V-ALPHA".
GOOD JOB BUT, YOU ARE TOO LATE... SORRY! (P.S A NEW SECURITY SYSTEM IS IN WORKS: "ANTI BYPASS VAULT")
